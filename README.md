# Procurement Workflow Information Management System

## Introduction
Procurement management is the process of acquiring goods and services for an organization. It involves sourcing, generating requests, placing orders, inspecting the supply received, sending invoices, and journaling the procurement process. Procurement management systems are digital systems that help organizations streamline and optimize this process, typically by automating certain tasks and providing a centralized platform for tracking and managing procurement activities.
